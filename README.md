## Intro

Tronscan provides a way for Super Representatives to publish their information right where the voters are, on Tronscan!

Super Representatives can use this template to build a static page which will be shown on Tronscan. The link will be placed in the voting overview page right next to the name.

By editing files in the repository on Github the Super Representative can manage their own content.


## Example

The example shows which files are presented where. Whenever the files on Github are modified the page will instantly be updated

## FA

* __I've modified a file but the changes aren't visible on tronscan.org?__  
  Contents from the repository are served using the Github CDN which uses aggressive caching. It may take a few minutes before the changes are reflected on tronscan.org.
* __Why are HTML elements visible on Github but not on tronscan.org?__  
  Tronscan.org will sanitize all HTML tags for security reasons, only standard markdown tags are allowed
